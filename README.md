# Intro to TensorFlow and Sentiment Analysis #

This repository contains the material I used during an introductory session about TensorFLow and Sentiment analysis. The session was delivered on January 4th, 2018 as the topic of the "MML Event #6: Intro to TensorFlow and Sentiment Analysis." Miami MeetUps event.
The material and code  I used came from the following resources:

- O’Reilly Learning TensorFlow - Tom Hope, Yehezkel S.
Ressheff & Itay Lieder -
– Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data
Analytics: Algorithms, Worked Examples, and Case Studies
(MIT Press) - John D. Kelleher, Mac Namee, Brian, Aoife
D'Arcy -
– Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree.
– Deep Learning Ian Goodfellow, Yoshu Bengio, and Aaron
Courville.

The repository contains the following documents:
1. A LibreOffice presentation in ODP format.
2. A PDF version of the LibreOffice presentation with the notes.
3. A jupyter notebook titled "Tensorflow_Regression."
4. An HTML version of the "Tensorflow_Regression" notebook.
5. A jupyter notebook titled "Sentiment_RNN."
6. An HTML version of the "Sentiment_RNN." notebook
7. Some dataset and images used in the above notebook.
8. The Anaconda minconda installation file "Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
"
NOTE: Make sure you create the directory "checkpoints" before running the RNN jupyter notebook. The directory stores the model checkpoint so you can use it again without having to re-train it.

Hope you find this material useful.
